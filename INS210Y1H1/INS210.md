Bescherelle: book of conjugated verbs (compiled, many, more tedious than scary lol)

- 25 for each verb class
- B: did what i told you to do, meets expectations
- A: has organization (table of contents), has things that help us use it better (descriptions, hints, tips, how you dropped a short "i" here, not having "too much white space" e.g. not detailed) can be in a different section
- Due before we get back from winter break
- `cutullemaya` bescherelle has useful tricks (ask for after due)
  - beforehand, look at other bescherelles (french)
- fun idea: make small python code to load this data in from json (or maybe something more readable) and bump it to SQL
  - bump this to nice pdf output (latex pages to be linked)

Lecture starting song: Eb major 6/4 + 5/4

Miigwech indikid nookomisag 
Miigwech indikid nimishoomisag 
Miigwech indikid indawenmaaganag 
We he ya he ya he yo
$$
\word{Miigwech}{thank you} \\
\word{indikid}{say} \\
\word{nookomis}{my Grandmother} \\
\word{nookomisa}{my Grandmothers} \\
\word{nimishoomis}{my Grandfather} \\
\word{indawenmaaganag}{my relatives} \\

#### Sounds

![image-20240909173714229](../../Images/INS210/image-20240909173714229.png)

Vowels:

- First three columns are short or weak vowels

- Four on the right are long or strong vowels

Consonants:

- At the end of words:
  - b's like p's
  - d's like t's
  - g's like k's
  - j's like ch
  - z like s
  - zh like sh
  - H like ' (glottal stop)
- m and n are quite salient
- w and y are not interchangeable, but kinda close
  - $\exmp \word{giiwe}{s/he goes home}$, giiye and gii'e are same

To get a sense for what they sound like, alongside some combination sounds:

![image-20240909173817080](../../Images/INS210/image-20240909173817080.png)

If singing twinkle twinkle little star to it, first three are short, last four are longer.

$\exmp$ Some combination sounds:
$$
\word{Anishinaabe indaaw}{I am Anishinaabe} & \text{[aaw, like "ou"ch]}\\
\word{O'ow}{this / that} & \text{[ow]} \\
\word{Bibaa-ayaayin}{when/if you're around} & \text{[aay, like "eye"]}
$$
To get more help with sounds, look up "Ojibwe Sound Chart" on YouTube.

#### Numbers

To make numbers from 1 to 1999:

![image-20240909174713835](../../Images/INS210/image-20240909174713835.png)

Construct in three columns, "-shi-" joining, saying the words left to right.

Tens: (roughly) add -tana or -dana

Hundreds: (roughly) add -waak

$\note$ Midaaswaak should have it's own column - just imagine it

$\note$ Codeswitching sometimes occurs into English spoken numerals?

$\note$ Midaaswi and other -swi words are also kinda pronounced -swe?

$\exmp \word{Ngodwaakshibezhig}{one hundred and one}$

To practice, try out Google Random number generator!

How to get to two thousand?

![image-20240909180413875](../../Images/INS210/image-20240909180413875.png)
$$
\word{Aaniish minik nching?}{How many times?} \\
\word{niibiniching}{lots of times}
$$
$\exmp$
$$
\word{niizhing midaaswaak-shi-bezhig}{2001} \\
\word{nswing midaaswaak-shi-nsimdana-shi-nswi}{3333} \\
\word{niiwing midaaswaak-shi-niiwaak-shi-niimdana-shi-niiwin}{4444} \\
\word{niizhwaaching midaaswaak-shi-niizhwaak-shi-nshwaasimdana-shi-nswe}{7283} \\
\word{midaaching midaaswaak-shi-nswaak-ngodwaasimdana-shi-naanan}{10365} \\
\word{nshwaaching midaaswaak-shi-niizhwaaswaak-shi-ngodwaaswi}{8706}
$$
When we add numbers to verbs, we may add them in front as such:

![image-20240909181058631](../../Images/INS210/image-20240909181058631.png)

Notice how the $\an{ngo-}$ is similar to the $\an{Ngod-}$ in $\an{Ngodwaak}$, both relating to $\en{one}$.

$\exmp$ Showing off some front number usage
$$
\word{ngodwaaso-dibagane}{it is 6 o'clock} \\
\word{Midaaso-biboon'igizi}{s/he is ten years old}
$$

#### Demonstrative Pronouns/Determiners

![image-20240909181624938](../../Images/INS210/image-20240909181624938.png)

Anishinaabemowin has animate and inanimate as classifications. Things that end in $\an{g}$ are animate, things that end in $\an{n}$ are inanimate (roughly speaking).

Animate:
$$
\word{maaba}{this} \\
\word{wa}{that} \\
\word{gondag}{these} \\
\word{giwi}{those}
$$
Inanimate:
$$
\word{maanda}{this} \\
\word{wi}{that} \\
\word{nonda}{these} \\
\word{niwin}{those}
$$
Table:

![image-20240909182529938](../../Images/INS210/image-20240909182529938.png)

We also somewhat use these to convey the word "the". If I walk into a room and say "Did you see the cat?", it's like... what cat? That's a specific cat. But if it's "Did you see a cat?" then that's more general.

Can also use the words to point out who someone is:
$$
\word{Andrew maaba}{This is Andrew}
$$


Other pronouns, usually not used unless trying to be very emphatic (e.g. "**I'm** hungry", "**I'm** the one who said it"):
$$
\word{Niin}{I/my/me/mine} \\
\word{Giin}{you/your/your/yours} \\
\word{Wiin}{s/he / h/ / h/ / h/}
$$
$\exmp$ The "this/that" words are used to replace the pronouns, and can refer to closeness:
$$
\word{Maaba nimosh bakade}{This dog is hungry} \\
\word{bakade maaba nimosh}{This dog is hungry} \\
\word{bakade wa}{s/he is hungry} & \text{[that one is hungry]}\\
\word{bakade maaba}{s/he is hungry} & \text{[this one is hungry]}\\
$$
Can say just $\an{bakade}$ if you're answering a question.

Other possibilities:

![image-20240909182538548](../../Images/INS210/image-20240909182538548.png)

#### Tenses

[Link](nsp.lol/day2)

[Conjugation PDF](nsp.lol/alisttoremember)

VAI (Verb animate intransitive), VII (Verb inanimate intransitive)

Some strange things can be animate! Cars, apples. Carrots sometimes?

VTA (Verb transitive animate), VTI (Verb transitive inanimate)

##### Verb Chart

Some basic tenses:

![image-20240909190323660](../../Images/INS210/image-20240909190323660.png)

$\note$ If using d-(V) and the first letter is `o`, then lengthen to `doo`

$\note$ When using the persons I and You, drop a short vowel at the end.

$\note$ To remember $\an{wii-}$ is the "want to\going to" future, just raise your arms and say "wee!", like yay i want to go to disneyland

Also recall the following rules for (V)-, (N)-, (M)-, and (N/M)-:

![image-20240909190445978](../../Images/INS210/image-20240909190445978.png)

$\exmp$ Let's try out this chart using the verb $\an{ikida}$, with the intent of "I will say"

<img src="../../Images/INS210/image-20240909191031851.png" alt="image-20240909191031851" style="zoom:150%;" />

1. Place $\an{ikida}$ in the middle column for VAI.
2. Select the $\en{I}$ from the leftmost column
3. Now work leftward from the middle.
   1. $\an{ga-}$, because "will"
   2. $\an{in-}$, because the "g" from $\an{ga-}$
4. Now work rightward from the middle
   1. Drop the short vowel $\an{-a}$
5. Result! $\an{inga-ikid}$

$\exmp$ More $\an{ikida}$ examples
$$
\word{da-ikida}{s/he will say} \\
\word{wii-ikidawag}{they want to say} \\
\word{inga-ikidamin}{we (exclusive) will say} \\
\word{giga-ikidamin}{we (inclusive) will say} \\
\word{da-ikidawag}{they will say}
$$

##### Persons

$\defn$ Fourth person (in the chart, his/her): I (1) can be talking to you (2), about someone else (3) and they know somebody else (4), thus fourth person.

$\exmp$ "A man (3) was talking to a woman (4).", "Did you (2) hear about John's (3) grandfather (4)?"

$\defn$ Unspecified person, so kind of hiding the person or taking the person out of it

- Also used in questions "How does one say? / How is it said?"

$\exmp$ "I was given tobacco", "There was sickness around"

$\defn$ Two different "we"'s

- Exclusive: Just you and some other people, telling a person who was not there
  - "We saw this person"
- Inclusive: All of us together
  - "I'm so excited for us to go rock climbing"
- So either excluding or including the person you're speaking to

##### Orders / Verb Forms

In Anishinaabemowin, there are a couple forms that verbs can take. We'll be looking at A, B, C, and D form: Independent, Conjunct, Changed Conjunct, and Imperative. Above was form "A".

$\defn$ Independent order (A) is used to make simple declarative statements and frequently yes/no questions

$\defn$ Conjunct order (B) is used to create subordinate clauses (sentences inside sentences) and some content questions

- Words that fit if, when, that, to

$\defn$ Changed conjunct order (C) is used to formulate relative clauses (sentences inside sentences) and content questions

$\defn$ Imperative order (D) is used to give commands

We can see the uses for these forms here:

![image-20240916180505084](../../Images/INS210/image-20240916180505084.png)

$\exmp$ Take this sentence:
$$
\text{I know that you know that I know what you know}
$$
In English, we use the words $\en{that}$ and $\en{what}$ in this sentence to express the difference sentences inside the larger sentence. In Anishinaabemowin, we use the different forms to differentiate the sentence and the sentences inside that sentence.

[Word List / Form A and B Charts](nsp.lol/cvai)

Let's check out form B:

<img src="../../Images/INS210/Screenshot 2024-09-09 193043.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-09 193043" style="zoom:130%;" />

$\note$ An arrow (e.g. (M)->ng) means to change the "-m" to "-ng"

You'll often use this form for words with if, when, that, to.

$\exmp$ Let's try out some words:
$$
\word{niwii-niim}{i want to dance} \\
\word{gichi-nendam}{s/he is happy} \\
\word{giishpin gichi-nendang}{if s/he is happy}
$$
Ending the class!
$$
\word{Baamaanpii niwiijikewenyig}{Later my friends} \\
\word{Baamaanpii giga-waabaminim}{I will see y'all later} \\
\word{Baamaanpii giga-waabamin}{I will see you}
$$

$$
$\exmp$ A few for Jiishda'ige (s/he sweeps)
$$
\word{ji-jiishda'igeyaanh}{so that I can sweep}
$$

##### Deriving C Form

This form can be derived using a process called Initial Vowel Change. Since the true name for B form is conjunct, and C form is changed conjunct, we can see that it's just a change. We'll change the **very first vowel of the root.**

![image-20240916175320891](../../Images/INS210/image-20240916175320891.png)

#### VII: Verb Inanimate Intransitive

Lots of weather terms, seasons...

<img src="../../Images/INS210/image-20240923175305164.png" alt="image-20240923175305164" style="zoom:150%;" />

$\note$ (D/N) is when the word ends with a $\an{d}$ or an $\an{n}$

$\note$ H/ means a thing belongs to someone

- $\exmp$ His or her shirt is blue $\to$ H/ shirt is blue

$\note$ H/s means multiple things belong to someone

- $\exmp$ His or her shoes are blue $\to$ H/s shoes are blue

$\note$ For B form, it and they are classed together, h/ and h/s are classed together

![image-20240923180056129](../../Images/INS210/image-20240923180056129.png)

$\note$ For C form, they is modified as well

$\note$ There is a typo in the above table for the tenses (should be initial vowel change)

$\exmp$
$$
\word{da-debse}{It is going to be sufficient}
$$

##### Plurals and Animacy

$$
\word{pabwin(an)}{chair(s)} \\
\word{ikwe(wag)}{woman(women)} \\
\word{akik(oog)}{pot(s)} \\
\word{giigidoo-biiyaapkoons(an)}{phone(s)}
$$

$\note$ If it ends with a $\an{-g/-k}$ in the plural, it's animate. If it ends with an $\an{-n}$, it's inanimate.

People and animals are always animate.

$\exmp$
$$
\an{giigidoo-biiyaapkoonsan gii-gagwetaan'gindenoon sa} \\
\boxed{\text{Phones were exceedingly expensive!}}
$$

#### Questions

Do you want something to drink? vs. What do you want to drink?

"Do you" is a yes/no question. "What do you" is a WH- question.

Not going to cover yes/no questions just yet!

![image-20240930173657139](../../Images/INS210/image-20240930173657139.png)

Default for C form is "who" and "what", so add that work. Same for "When".

The other small words are called relative roots. They stick on the verb before you put them in the chart.

Different communities use many different WH- words:

Lots of variation! But we'll stick with the ones in the first chart.

$\defn$ Here are the relative roots:

![image-20240930174059117](../../Images/INS210/image-20240930174059117.png)

They get stuck onto verbs, but also sometimes are built into the verb, and sometimes are even their own word. If there's two in a box, sometimes it sounds like one or the other.

$\note$ The big "N" in $\an{iN}$ signals an alternation, where $\an{n}$ changes to $\an{zh}$. We'll see this more in VTA.

$\note$ "to such a place" can also be read as "to a certain place", and for all other "such" we can also replace with "a certain"

$\exmp$ Forming questions:
$$
\wordvai{wiisini}{s/he eats} \\
\word{Wenesh gaa-wiisinid?}{Who ate?} \\
\word{Wenesh bekaded?}{Who is hungry?} \\
\wordvai{ikido}{s/he says [it]} \\
\word{Wegnesh gaa-ikidoyin?}{What did you say?} \\
\wordvii{jaagde}{it is burnt} \\
\wordvai{jaagiza}{s/he is burnt} \\
\word{Wegnesh jayaagdeg?}{What is burnt?} \\
\word{Aaniish pii gaa-wiisiniyin?}{When did you eat?} \\
\word{Aaniish pii mayaajaayin?}{When are you leaving?}
$$
$\note$ We use "s/he" pronoun for "who?" conjugation.

$\exmp$ Exercise, make a "What" question and a "When"
$$
\wordvai{wiisini}{s/he eats} \\
\word{Wegnesh gaa-wiisiniyin?}{What did you eat?} \\
\wordvai{gagwedwe}{s/he asks, asks a question} \\
\word{Aaniish pii gaa-gagwedweyaanh?}{When did I ask?} \\
$$
$\exmp$ Examples from the class

\word{Aaniish pii gaa-wiisiniyin?}{When did you eat?} \\
$$
$\exmp$ Why: Aaniish + onji-C Form
$$
\word{Aaniish gaanji-wiisinid?}{Why did s/he eat?} \\
\word{Aaniish enji-bizikaamigag?}{Why does it come from there?} \\
\word{Aaniish wenji-gagwedweyin?}{Why do you ask?} \\

\wordvai{dagoshin}{s/he arrives} \\
\word{Aaniish gaazhi-dagoshiniyin}{How did you get here?}
$$
$\note$ "Get" is used a lot in English, many different contexts. Need to be more specific in Anishinaabemowin!

$\exmp$ How (to a certain degree): Aaniish apiichi-C Form
$$
\wordvai{Aakozi}{s/he is sick} \\
\word{Aaniish epiichi-aakoziyin?}{How sick are you?} \\

$$
$\exmp$ Where: Aabiish + B Form (unless relative root, then C)
